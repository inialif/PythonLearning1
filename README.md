# Python Learning Guide
Welcome to the Python Beginners Guide! ðŸ™Œ

If you're starting your journey into the world of Python programming, you're in the right place. This README will provide you with a clear understanding of some essential data types in Python, making your learning experience engaging and straightforward.
## Python Data Types
---
In Python, data types will help you manipulate and work with different types of data in your programs. Let's get to know the most common data types in Python:

### Numbers
---
Number data types are divided into three, namely:  Integer, Float, and Complex
#### 1. Integer(int)
Whole numbers consist of positive or negative numbers, without decimal places and unlimited length
example : {-5, 8, 9}

#### 2. Float
A float is a number that can have one or more decimal places
example : {0.8, -0.09, 0.005}

#### 3. Complex
Complex numbers are very useful for advanced mathematical and engineering applications. The value of an imaginary number in Python is denoted by ( x + yj ), where x is a real number and y is an imaginary number
example : {2 + 9j, 3 - 6j}


### String
---
Strings are used to represent text or data. In Python, you can enclose strings in single quotes (' ') or double quotes (" "). They are important for handling textual information.


### Boolean
---
Boolean or Bool is a data type derived from integers which only has two constants, namely: True and False.

## Other data types in python
---
### 1. List
Lists are a type of ordered data collection and are one of the variables that are often used in Python. Similar, but not the same as arrays in other programming languages. The difference is, List elements in Python do not have to have the same data type. Declaring a List is enough with square brackets ([]) or with elements separated by commas (,)
