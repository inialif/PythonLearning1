# Python Learning Guide
Welcome to the Python Beginners Guide! ðŸ™Œ

If you're starting your journey into the world of Python programming, you're in the right place. This README will provide you with a clear understanding of some essential data types in Python, making your learning experience engaging and straightforward.
## Python Data Types
---
In Python, data types will help you manipulate and work with different types of data in your programs. Let's get to know the most common data types in Python:

### Numbers
---
Number data types are divided into three, namely:  Integer, Float, and Complex
#### 1. Integer(int)
Whole numbers consist of positive or negative numbers, without decimal places and unlimited length
example : {-5, 8, 9}

#### 2. Float
A float is a number that can have one or more decimal places
example : {0.8, -0.09, 0.005}

#### 3. Complex
Complex numbers are very useful for advanced mathematical and engineering applications. The value of an imaginary number in Python is denoted by ( x + yj ), where x is a real number and y is an imaginary number
example : {2 + 9j, 3 - 6j}


### String
---
Strings are used to represent text or data. In Python, you can enclose strings in single quotes (' ') or double quotes (" "). They are important for handling textual information.


### Boolean
---
Boolean or Bool is a data type derived from integers which only has two constants, namely: True and False.

## Other data types in python
---
### List
Lists are a type of ordered data collection and are one of the variables that are often used in Python. Similar, but not the same as arrays in other programming languages. The difference is, List elements in Python do not have to have the same data type. Declaring a List is enough with square brackets ([]) or with elements separated by commas (,)

### Set
Focuses on sets in Python, which are unordered, mutable collections of unique elements. Sets are created using curly braces {} and can perform set operations like union and intersection.
+ Union =  Combines two sets to create a new set containing all unique elements.
+ Intersection = Finds common elements between two sets and creates a new set.

### Slicing
Covers the concept of slicing in Python, which allows you to extract a subset of elements from a sequence like a list, string, or tuple using the slicing operator [:].

### Tuple
Discusses tuples in Python, which are ordered, immutable collections of items. Tuples are created using parentheses () and can contain elements of different data types.

### Dictionary
Discusses dictionaries in Python, which are unordered, mutable collections of key-value pairs. Dictionaries are created using curly braces {} and can be used to store and retrieve data efficiently.
+ Nested Dictionary = A dictionary that contains another dictionary as a value


## Operators
---
You'll learn about operators in Python, which are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Operators are essential for performing arithmetic, comparison, logical, and other types of operations in Python.

### Addition
Discusses the addition operator (+) in Python, used to add numerical values together or concatenate strings.

### Substraction
Covers the subtraction operator (-) in Python, used to subtract numerical values or find the difference between them.

### Multiplication
+ Focuses on the multiplication operator (*) in Python, used to multiply numerical values or repeat strings.
+ Repeats a string a specified number of times using the multiplication operator.
+ Raises a number to the power of another number using the double asterisk ** operator.
+ Square root: Calculates the square root of a number using the exponentiation operator.

### Division
Discusses the division operator (/) in Python, used to divide numerical values and return a floating-point result.
+ Floor Division: Returns the quotient of the division without the remainder.

### Modulus 
Covers the modulus operator (%) in Python, used to find the remainder of the division between two numbers.


## Variables
---
Variables are containers for storing data values. In this section, you'll understand how variables work in Python, including variable declaration, assignment, data types, scope, and naming conventions.

### String Formatting with Variables
This topic may cover string formatting in Python, which allows you to create formatted strings by inserting variables into placeholders within a string.

### % Operator with Argument Specifier
Covers the % operator with argument specifiers in Python, used for string formatting with placeholders to insert variables.

### Input and Output
Focuses on input and output operations in Python, including reading user input from the console using the input() function and displaying output using the print() function.



## Conditional Formatting
---
Conditional expressions in Python play a crucial role in controlling the flow of a program based on certain conditions. Conditional Expressions allow to make decisions and execute specific code blocks depending on whether the conditions are met or not.

### IF
Discusses the foundational if statement in Python, which is used for decision-making and executing a block of code only if a condition is true.

### ELSE
This topic may refer to the general usage of the else statement in Python, which is used in conditional statements to execute a block of code when the condition is false.

### ELIF
Discusses the elif statement in Python, which stands for "else if" and is used to check multiple conditions after an initial if statement.


## Loop
---
Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. This section explains different types of loops in Python, including for loops and while loops, and how they are used to iterate over sequences or perform repetitive tasks.

### FOR
Focuses on the for loop in Python, which is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) or other iterable objects.

### NESTED FOR
Discusses the concept of nested for loops in Python, where one loop is placed inside another loop to perform more complex iterations.

### ELSE after FOR
Covers the else statement used in conjunction with a for loop in Python. The else block is executed when the loop completes all iterations without encountering a break statement.

### WHILE
Discusses the while loop in Python, which repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

### ELSE after WHILE
Focuses on the else statement used with a while loop in Python. The else block is executed when the loop condition becomes false.



## BREAK and CONTINUE
---
This section covers the break and continue statements in Python, which are used to alter the flow of loops. These statements help control the iteration process and exit or skip parts of the loop based on certain conditions.

### Break
Focuses on the break statement in Python, used to exit a loop prematurely based on a specific condition. It is often used to terminate the loop early when a certain criterion is met.

### Continue
Discusses the continue statement used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. It is often used to avoid executing certain code based on specific conditions.


## List Comprehenssion
---
List comprehension is a concise way to create lists in Python by iterating over an existing sequence or iterable object. This section explains how list comprehension works and its benefits in terms of readability and efficiency.

+ Discusses list comprehension in Python, which provides a compact way to create lists by iterating over an existing sequence or iterable object.
+ Another way to write list comprehension with 'new_list = [expression for_loop_one_or_more conditions].
